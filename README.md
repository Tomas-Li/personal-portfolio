## Personal porfolio:

Based on a FreeCodeCamp tutorial but re-built from scratch (I liked the end result but not how it was achieved)

This was a fast to do portfolio that I wanted to rebuild from scratch just to test if I could copy its animations without watching the original source code.
Not my favourite kind of design, but the html tags that were being use as decoration, all the animated letters with hover effects,the rotating cube and finally the loaders caught my attention.
